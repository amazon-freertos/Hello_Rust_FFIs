# 'Hello, World' Rust FFI examples

These two projects demonstrate the basic idea behind Rust / C interoperability. The `call_rust_from_c` project demonstrates how to build a Rust function into a library which can be linked to in a C application. And the `generate_freertos_rust_bindings` demonstrates how to auto-generate Rust bindings for an existing C library, in this case the FreeRTOS kernel.
